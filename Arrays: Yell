Write a method yell(words) that takes in an array of words and returns a
new array where every word from the original array has an exclamation point after it.

def yell(words)
count = 0
  exc = []
  while count < words.length
    word = words[count]
    nuWord = word + '!'
    exc << nuWord
    count+=1
  end
  return exc
end

print yell(["hello", "world"]) # => ["hello!", "world!"]
puts
print yell(["code", "is", "cool"]) # => ["code!", "is!", "cool!"
