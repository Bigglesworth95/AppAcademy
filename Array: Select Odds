def select_odds(numbers)
array = []
  count = 0 
  while count < numbers.length
    if numbers[count] %2 == 1
      array << numbers[count]
    end
    count +=1 
  end
  return array
end

print select_odds([13, 4, 3, 7, 6, 11]) # => [13, 3, 7, 11]
puts
print select_odds([2, 4, 6])            # => []
