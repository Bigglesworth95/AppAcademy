Write a method select_long_words(words) that takes in an array of words and returns a new array containing all of the words of the original array that are longer than 4 characters.


def select_long_words(words)
longWords = []
  count = 0 
  while count < words.length
    if words[count].length > 4
      longWords << words[count]
    end
    count += 1
  end
  return longWords
end

print select_long_words(["what", "are", "we", "eating", "for", "dinner"]) # => ["eating", "dinner"]
puts
print select_long_words(["keep", "coding"])                               # => ["coding"]
