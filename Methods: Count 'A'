Write a method count_a(word) that takes in a string word and returns the number of a's in the word. The method should count both lowercase (a) and uppercase (A)

def count_a(word)
  aCount = 0
  count = 0 
  while count <= word.length
    if word[count] == 'a' || word[count] == 'A'
      aCount +=1
    end
    count +=1
  end
puts aCount
end

puts count_a("application")  # => 2
puts count_a("bike")         # => 0
puts count_a("Arthur")       # => 1
puts count_a("Aardvark")     # => 3
