The fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers whose first and second elements are 1. 
To generate further elements of the sequence we take the sum of the previous two elements. 
For example the first 6 fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. Write a method fibonacci that takes in a number length and returns the fibonacci sequence up to the given length.


def fibonacci(length)
arr = []
  (1..length).each do |i|
    if arr.length < 2
      arr << 1
    else
      arr << arr[-1] + arr[-2]
    end
  end
  return arr
end

print fibonacci(0) # => []
puts
print fibonacci(1) # => [1]
puts
print fibonacci(6) # => [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
puts
print fibonacci(8) # => [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
puts
