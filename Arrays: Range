Write a method range(min, max) that takes in two numbers min and max. The method should return an array containing all numbers from min to max inclusive.

def range(min, max)
array = [min]
  while min < max
    min +=1
    array << min
  end
  return array
end

print range(2, 7)   # => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
puts
print range(13, 20) # => [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
