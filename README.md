This is my AppAcademy Portfolio
You will find all my info from AppAcademy inside.

For the intro to programming stuff, it's all super basic and boring. If you're a prospective employer reviewing this, then I would recommend skipping the intro stuff simply because it's so basic that you would really have business even thinking about applying for a job without knowing this stuff. It was useful, however, in that it taught me the syntax for ruby, since I've only ever done python stuff before.
