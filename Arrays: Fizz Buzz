Write a method fizz_buzz(max) that takes in a number max and returns an array containing all numbers greater than 0 and less 
than max that are divisible by either 4 or 6, but not both.


def fizz_buzz(max)
count = 1 
  array = []
  while count < max
    if (count%4 == 0 || count%6 == 0) && count%12!=0
      array << count
    end
    count +=1
  end
  return array
end

print fizz_buzz(20) # => [4, 6, 8, 16, 18]
puts
print fizz_buzz(15) # => [4, 6, 8]
