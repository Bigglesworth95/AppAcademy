Write a method reverse(word) that takes in a string word and returns the word with its letters in reverse order.

def reverse(word)
count = 0
reverseWord = ""
  while count < word.length
    letter = word[count]
    reverseWord = letter + reverseWord
    count+=1
  end
  puts reverseWord
end

puts reverse("cat")          # => "tac"
puts reverse("programming")  # => "gnimmargorp"
puts reverse("bootcamp")     # => "pmactoob"
