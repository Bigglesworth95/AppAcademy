Write a method hand_score that takes in a string representing a hand of cards and returns it's total score. 
You can assume the letters in the string are only A, K, Q, J. A is worth 4 points, K is 3 points, Q is 2 points, and J is 1 point. 
The letters of the input string not necessarily uppercase.

def hand_score(hand)
hash = {}
  hash ['A'] = 4
  hash['K'] = 3
  hash['Q'] = 2
  hash['J'] = 1
sum = 0 
  hand.each_char {|let| sum += hash[let.upcase]}

return sum
end

puts hand_score("AQAJ") #=> 11
puts hand_score("jJka") #=> 9
