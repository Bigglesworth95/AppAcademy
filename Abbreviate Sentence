Write a method abbreviate_sentence that takes in a sentence string and returns a new sentence where every word longer than 4 characters has all of it's vowels removed.



def remove_vowels(word)
  vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
  newWord = ''
  count = 0 
  while count < word.length
    if vowels.include? word[count] 
    else
      newWord += word[count]
    end
    count +=1 
  end
  return newWord
end
      

def abbreviate_sentence(sent)
words = sent.split(" ")
  newWords = []
  count = 0
  
  while count < words.length
    if words[count].length > 4
      newWords << remove_vowels(words[count])
    else
      newWords << words[count]
    end
    count +=1 
  end
  return newWords.join(" ")
end

puts abbreviate_sentence("follow the yellow brick road") # => "fllw the yllw brck road"
puts abbreviate_sentence("what a wonderful life")        # => "what a wndrfl life"
